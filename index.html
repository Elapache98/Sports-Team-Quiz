            Create your "inputs" here, following the example. Please do not add CSS for this assignment. Only use HTML tags and JavaScript as detailed in the instructions.

            Your form must provide AT LEAST 4 different questions for the user to respond to. Your JavaScript must then analyze these answers using conditional logic.

            Please use only <select> tags this week for multiple-choice questions. Make every <option> a valid choice. DO NOT have default choice that only serves as a prompt for the user. The text NEXT TO the <select> tag should provide the user with the question or instructions, just as your <input> fields did on Lab Homework #2.

            Make your form look as "neat" as possible using the tags that you have learned in class. You may additionally use other formatting tags (such as header tags) if you want to research and use them.

            IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT: If you use tags or input types other than the ones shown in class (p, input types "text" and "select", div, label), above your first use of each one you need to provide an HTML comment explaining what the tag or type is used for (so that we know you understand it).

            You may only use <input> fields if you're asking the user for a Number, and you must make sure that you account for ALL Numbers if you do this. If the user can only choose from a small range of numbers, consider making your life easier by using a <select> menu.

            PLEASE NOTE: Doing anything beyond using dropdown menus via the "select" tag is ENTIRELY optional. We really want you to focus on conditional logic this week, and that is what you are primarily being graded on!

            Please DELETE THIS COMMENT before submitting your work!
